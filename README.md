# Intelligent Service Recommendation Engine

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for an Intelligent Service Recommendation Engine, which provides recommendations for users based on their preferences and interactions with the system. The recommendation engine employs various similarity measures and collaborative filtering techniques to generate personalized recommendations.
(this was an assessment that needed to be done without any libraries imported)

## Features
- **User Interface:** Provides an interactive interface for users to browse recommendations, view book details, and explore different similarity measures.
- **Data Loading:** Loads book and user data from CSV files, allowing users to analyze ratings and generate recommendations.
- **Similarity Measures:** Implements different similarity measures such as Pearson correlation coefficient, cosine similarity, and Minkowski distance to calculate similarities between users or books.
- **Recommendation Generation:** Generates personalized recommendations for users based on their preferences and interactions with the system.
- **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling to gracefully handle missing or invalid data.

## Usage
Once the recommendation engine is running, follow these steps to use it:

1. Navigate through the interactive interface to load book and user data.
2. Choose the option to generate recommendations based on similarity measures or collaborative filtering techniques.
3. Explore the recommended books and view their details, including title, author, rating, and publication year.
4. Experiment with different similarity measures to observe how they affect the generated recommendations.
5. Provide feedback or suggestions for improving the recommendation engine.
